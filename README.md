This is a fork project from Tomaanina Android Application from Shefrah Team aimes too traduce the project into french.

Tomaanina is Islamic Android application helps users to know prayers times, get notification on Adhan ( prayer call) and turn the mobile into silent mode during the prayers time.
It's an open source application. 

The main purpose of this actual project is to add source code from http://praytimes.org because the prayer time calculations are based off the brother Dr. Hamid Zarrabi-Zadeh.
